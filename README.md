# Google Brain - Ventilator Pressure Prediction

## Simulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patient's lung

Current simulators are trained as an ensemble, where each model simulates a single lung setting. However, lungs and their attributes form a continuous space, so a parametric approach must be explored that would consider the differences in patient lungs.mPartnering with Princeton University, the team at Google Brain aims to grow the community around machine learning for mechanical ventilation control. They believe that neural networks and deep learning can better generalize across lungs with varying characteristics than the current industry standard of PID controllers.
